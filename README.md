# Final Code Assessment

This should be a final assessment of your individual ability to write code. 
This assignment will be open book except where noted, but don't collaborate with
fellow students. You can ask TAs and instructors clarifying questions but not debugging or guidance
questions.

For this assignment I've given you the boilerplate of a simple full stack
Javascript application. You'll have to find all the spots where I've placed a
TODO comment run this command: `cat <(grep TODO *.js) <(grep -r TODO app) <(grep -r TODO test)` 
and fill the in the code that is needed to satisfy the request. This is more of 
a completion assignment than one you'll be graded on but make sure to follow 
best practices.

# To Submit Your Assignment
**READ THIS BEFORE BEGINNING TO WRITE CODE**
*Feel free to have TAs help you with the submission process.*

This assignment is going to be a little different with the submission process
in order to keep the solutions confidential (I want to use this or something
like it for future classes).

First, clone this repository to your local machine (do not fork your own version of it).
Then finish your solution and commit the results. Now instead of pushing your
changes to master I want you to create a patch file, which will be what you
submit in canvas. In order to create a patch file run this command from the root
of your clone: `git format-patch fad91f73c4859ceec5b83e21cda3d3149a984026`. 
This should create a patch file in the root of your directory, submit this file 
in canvas.
