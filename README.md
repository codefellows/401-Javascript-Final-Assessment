# Final Code Assessment

This is a final assessment of your individual ability to write code. This assignment will be open book except where noted, but don't collaborate with fellow students. You can ask TAs and instructors clarifying questions but not debugging or guidance questions.

For this assignment you have recieved the boilerplate of a simple full stack Javascript application. You'll have to find all the spots where comments marked `// TODO` or `<!-- TODO -->` have been placed in the application code base. Each _TODO_ comment contains instuctions for features that need to be implemented. Find and fill the in the code that is needed to satisfy each _TODO_'s request. Make sure to follow the best practices covered in the 401.

To find all the _TODO_ comments run this command:  
`cat <(grep TODO *.js) <(grep -r TODO app) <(grep -r TODO test)`
